## 1. What is Generative AI?

Generative artificial intelligence (also known as Generative AI or Gen AI) has in recent months emerged as a powerful and robust tool that can be used to generate content in various formats including text, image, audio and video. In this course, our focus is on text generation and the underlying method for producing such text is made possible by large language models (LLMs). Briefly, as the name imply, LLM is a language model that has been trained on a large data set as well as large number of parameters. Such LLM models can be used for text generation that can be applied in a wide range of use cases:
- Brainstorm ideas
- Generate blog drafts
- Generate social posts
- Copy writing

Probably the most popular and well-known LLM is ChatGPT, which in a matter of days had reached 1 million users and is approximately supporting over 100 million users. Not only is ChatGPT used by the general public, developers and indie hackers are building some interesting and innovative tools for tackling various use cases.

Technically, the underlying LLM model powering ChatGPT is GPT 3.5 and it has established itself as a gold standard model from which other emerging models are compared against owing to its presence as the first model to market along with its reasonably good performance and low cost.

## 2. Benefits of Generative AI?

Generative AI has pioneered a new era of possibilities where an area that has received a remarkable boost is content creation. 

Gone are the days where we would stare at a blank document with a blinking cursor that is infamously known as the Writer's block.

With a well crafted prompt, one could brainstorm and generate hundreds of possible ideas then subsequently turn those idea seeds to an outline and even a longer form draft.
